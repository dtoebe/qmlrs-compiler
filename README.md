# qmlrs-compiler
WIP (very early) compiler for qmlrs (https://github.com/cyndis/qmlrs) qml bindings for Rust

## By Work in Progress I really mean it _NOT WORKING YET_

Basically I am very new to rust and wanted to create a compiler to compile QML files in to the compiled Rust binaries, simular to the compiler that Go-QML has.

I am taking a simple approch that this will take the QML file and add it to the Rust source code as a String.

Everything at this point is subject to change.

### What I would like to do:

[] Compile QML files into Rust binaries
[] Compile images with rust binaries
[] See where this takes me...
